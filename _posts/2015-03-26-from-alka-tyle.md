May Dr Johari's soul rest in peace and may God give you and the entire Johari family the strength to bear his unexpected loss. 

Reading about his life, it is clear he was a person of principle and conviction and lived by them. His life has many lessons for us all. Thank you for sharing the details about his life and achievements and his service to the community.
