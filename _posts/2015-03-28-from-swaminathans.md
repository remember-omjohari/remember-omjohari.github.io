We are sorry to hear about Dr. Om Johari's demise. 
We were fortunate to be a part of the music group for a long time and always enjoyed his interest in hosting it, making sure everybody got a chance to sing and more importantly that people listened to every artist performing!
Sending you all  strength to bear the  loss and may his soul rest in peace. 

*Swaminathans*
