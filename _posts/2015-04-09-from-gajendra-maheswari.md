To say Om Uncle was a very dynamic personality, is an understatement of
his persona. Each time we met him, we learnt numerous things and
tried to follow the same in our life. He may not be physically with us
today, but he will stay alive in our memories forever!

On his last visit to India, we got a chance to spend some quality time with him.  
We categorically remember a story shared by him: a father lost
his young son, but on the very next day following his daily schedule he went
to the pub in his neighbourhood.  His friends were surprised
to see him and they asked how come he was there on the very next day of
his son's demise? He replied, "sooner or later I have to accept that my
son won't be visiting me, and I have decided 'sooner'"

We have been on the mailing list of Om Uncle for long and now we also need
to accept that he won't be sending any more mails, but we will always have
the unlimited treasure of knowledge shared by him that will remain useful
throughout our life.
