Om is my rock. He has taught me how to meditate and has provided me with the tools I need for inspiration and meditation. He has taught me many types of meditation from laughing to grieving. As I grieve with the family, I look to his spirit for enlightenment. Thank you Om. You will always be by my side. You have taught me how to find peace in my life.
