As his name was so immortal so were his deeds and loving gratitude for everyone he met.He sacrificed his life for his principals and ideals and teach others how to live a life of Nishkama Karma in a very simple way possible.I salute him for his generosity and humanity wherever he may be.Blessings from my heart.  Akhilesh Gupta
