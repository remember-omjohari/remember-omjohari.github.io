It was quite a shock to hear about Dr. Om Johariâ€™s passing away.
I always felt he had a very peaceful aura about him, which was very calming. I had a few email conversations with him and he was always open, accepting and giving. He was grateful for every interaction, which reminded me of having a positive outlook and be grateful. He will be definitely missed. May his soul rest in peace.
