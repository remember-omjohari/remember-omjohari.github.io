My deepest sympathy and condolences to Om's family.  I met Om during his meditation presentations at the Schaumburg library.  He opened my mind and heart to the wonderful benefits that meditation could bring to our lives.  Shortly after my own dad passed away in 2012, I talked to Om about my grief and he sent me a beautiful meditation on death and grief that I still read and re-read to this day.  Just being in his presence and hearing his calming, soft voice was always such a comfort.  What a wonderfully humble, spiritually wise man he was.  He touched so many lives.  I'll miss him and receiving his email texts of meditations.  May God rest his soul in peace.  My prayers to the Johari family for strength during this sad time.

*Sincerely, Jo Ann Krones*
