A most sincere thank you to Om's, wife, sons, and family for writing and sharing the story of his life.  It was meaningful to have the opportunity to learn more about him and I was touched by the love and dedication that went into writing it.  I met him at the Elk Grove meditation class and he was quite a remarkable person, who left a lasting impression.  He transferred wonderful meditation techniques to his students helping us to achieve calmness and fullness in life.  I am saddened to hear of his death and deeply sorry for your loss. I wish you peace in the beautiful memories you have of him.
