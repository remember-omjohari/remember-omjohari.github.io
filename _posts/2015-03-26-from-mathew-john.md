I’m deeply saddened by the passing of your father, Dr. Om Johari.  He was such a fine man and whoever touched his life has become his friend. I’m such a lucky guy. I have had an opportunity to witness his passion, dedication and loyalty to his job  when I got my training as a driver safety instructor candidate.  He was a man with deep conviction and sincerity. He loved to help others even after his death. He will be missed for a very long time and I will keep all of you in my prayers as you are going through the most difficult time of your lives.
