Om Johari will be sorely missed at the Fox Lake District Library by staff and patrons alike.  He frequently taught both meditation and AARP Driver Safety classes here. He was always an upbeat and kind person that everyone wanted to be around and I personally really enjoyed the opportunity to work with him and to get to know him.
