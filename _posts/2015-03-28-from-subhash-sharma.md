It was indeed a shock to hear the sudden news about Dr. Johari's passing away. What I remember the most about him was his humility and humble disposition. He never bragged about all his academic and professional accomplishments and accolades that he earned during his life and career. His dedication, selfless, and exemplary contributions to society will always be cherished in our hearts, and inspire many lives that he touched.

May God provide peace and comfort to his departed soul and give the family the strength to bear this irreparable loss.
