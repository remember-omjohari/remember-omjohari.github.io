Om… I met you just seven weeks ago… and yet… you left footprints in my heart!

Your teachings, your spirit and your beautiful soul have become an eternal flame within me that will guide and inspire my journey forever.

Thank you for all you shared with me, for showing me how much beauty there is in meditation, in the simplicity of things, and in being selfless.

Thank you for allowing me to see your courage in letting go when your moment came.  Thank you for reminding me how temporary life is and the importance of living it to the fullest.

You taught me to meditate in so many ways… to accept others without judgement, and to honor myself, embracing all that it means to be me!  Your body is gone but your spirit resides in me forever… I love you and always will.
