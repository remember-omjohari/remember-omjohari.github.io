Dr. Om Johari passed away on March 18, 2015.  He is survived by his wife, Anu, and his two sons, Mahesh and Ramesh.  The family established this page as a way to remember and celebrate his life, and give the many people he touched a way to share their remembrances with others.

Please e-mail remembrances---text, images, and video---to <remember.omjohari@gmail.com>.  As we receive them, we will post them to the site.
