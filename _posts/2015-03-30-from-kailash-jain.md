Sarla and I are deeply saddened by the passing of your father, Dr. Om Johari. We have known Dr, Johari (Saab) for over 25 years and Maheshji through your heart felt and beautifully written eulogy we learned lot more about his exemplary academic, professional accomplishments, and honors. His generosity and kindness knew no bounds.  About ten years ago it was a great privilege for us to take an “Om Johari tour of Chicago” It was so much fun at Bahai temple.  During his visits to Detroit his presentations at our home and at Troy community center demonstrated his dedication, selfless, and exemplary character to help, teach, and inspire all the attendees and that will always be cherished. His emails on health, wellness, and spiritual upliftment were and still are a great source knowledge and wisdom. God bless you Dr. Johari. You will be greatly missed and we salute you for having touched our lives.
