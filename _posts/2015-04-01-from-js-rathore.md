Our dear Dr. Om Johri was an enlightened soul - full of love  sharing his Atma Gyan  with all helping them on the spiritual path. We read in Srimad Bhagavad Gita that Lord Krishna gave this knowledge to Arjun. Krishna calls this knowledge not just Guhya but most secret. Krishna gives this knowledge that inevitably leads to that Supreme Knowledge. Dr. Om Johri kept this tradition of Avatars and Spiritual Seers by not only imparting this knowledge freely but also by holding the hands of seekers of Truth and guiding them on the path. I salute Dr. Om Johri.
