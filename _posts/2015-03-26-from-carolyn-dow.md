When I last saw Om leading what I didn't know then was going to be his last meditation session at the Arlington Heights Senior Center on Monday, March 9th, I could see that he was standing differently and was not quite as jovial as his usual self. Thank you so much for letting us all know what happened to our dedicated teacher.

Om devoted so much of his life in retirement to making sure that seniors remembered how to drive safely and/or how to meditate to achieve peace inside. And he didn't ask for any recompense in return except that some of us might lean to practice what he taught.  What's more, he was constantly practicing what he preached. He would not allow any student's question to make him reply in anything but a patient and kind manner. I was really impressed by that talent and have been trying my best to do the same.

I will miss his enthusiasm, positive energy and guiding thoughts.
