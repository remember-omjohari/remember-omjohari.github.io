I am fond of Om immediately after first meeting of ours during his India visit in year 2013. I am regularly in wait of his e mails on different topics of life. He has great understanding of life which he shared with all with open hands. His words "with love and gratitude Om"  also light my path  like Om himself came before me. Om has justifies the existence of unbroken sound within every one i.e om the ultimate mantra of life on every human being.
with regards and love to Him Om.............................
