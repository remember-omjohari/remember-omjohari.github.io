 I came in contact with Dr Om Johari, when he visited Delhi about 2 years back. He conducted evening camp at Osho Centre, Malviya Nagar. I was just bowled over by his humility and deep understanding of meditation and right way of living which he learnt from OSHO and other great masters. He shared his experience about Diabetes and other disorders afflicting many people. He was fully aware of latest research and all of us benefited from him. After that he was regularly sending meditation texts compiled after devoting lot of time & effort. I salute him for endless zeal to help others, who are trying to become peaceful & be in harmony with source of life.

   It is very heartening to know that he was totally at peace, when he crossed to other shore and achieved eternal bliss.
All of us have lost a great friend and I share grief with the family.
