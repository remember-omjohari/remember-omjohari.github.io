Om & I joined IIT , Kharagpur at the same time Our Branches
were different . He was in Metallurgical Engg. & I was in Electrical Engg.
We were next door neighbours for 4 years . In Radha Krishnan Hall of 
Residence , his Room No. was 324 C & mine was 325 C.

He was a great Campaigner for right cause & never accepted 
defeat. He did not eat Onion & Garlic . He approached Mess Committee
for  getting food without onion/garlic .After persistent efforts on part of Om,
they consented to get separate food cooked provided at least  5 nos.
Students are there. S.M. Agarwal , Room No. 316 C & I joined him . It was
Om's sheer doggedness that he persuaded 4 more Students to join in this
battle. Food with out Onion & Garlic was cooked for 7 students from
that day.

Once he was Travelling from Jodhpur to Kharagpur. Instead of travelling
via Gomoh Junction , he took a slightly longer but more convenient route via
Howrah ( Calcutta )  . Train Ticket Inspector charged Rs. 1= 00 extra then 
applicable . Om continued to correspond with Railways till they refunded the
extra money . During this battle , I asked him what will be the net gain . He 
told me that his father is an advocate , who represents Railways also in Legal
cases. He has taught him always to fight for a just cause.

Om was also a great Motivator. He motivated & persuaded me to join 
NCC.

Om was very punctual . He replied to each & every letter . Lunch Recess
was from 11 AM to 1 PM. After taking Lunch , a good majority of Students
took a nap . But Om utilised this time in writing/replying letters.

He was very regular in studies . Even during Examination days , he rarely
increased his study hours .

Even after IIT days , I always got prompt replies  from him.  His studies
on Food Items were so deep & exhaustive that a person  not aware of his 
background , could have easily mistook him as Food Technologist.   

Meditation & SUDOKU  were his favourite subjects  I also came to know
that he is giving Driving lectures . Once my wife Usha & participated in a training
programme conducted by him in Delhi on Meditation & Relaxation Techniques.
The audience was spellbound.

That was GREAT  OM  JOHARI , as I knew him. He can not be forgotten.
May his soul rest in peace.
