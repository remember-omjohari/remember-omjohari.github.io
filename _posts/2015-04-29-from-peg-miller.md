It is with great sadness that I write this memory.  Om was patient, kind and very knowledgeable.  When our AARP Driver Safety website  was started, I wasnâ€™t very good at it.  He patiently taught me the way.  He was a born leader and educator.  His time with us was too short, but he made the most of that time.  I am proud to have known this great man.  He will live on in our hearts.
