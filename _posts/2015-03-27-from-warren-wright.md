My time with Dr. Om was very brief, one year as a student at the Aspen Library. Dr. Om's presentations helped me to be a more loving and aware observer. I was happy that some of the teachers that had influenced him were many of those that had also influenced me. He left me with the impression that he was honored to serve and grateful for my participation.
With gratitude I thank him for helping me along my own path towards Truth.
God Bless you Om Johari.

*With gratitude, Warren Wright*
