It is indeed a great loss to the community by his sudden demise.
Got to know Om Ji through the meditation sessions/classes at the Wheeling Library.
Had the opportunity of meeting his wife too a few times, while she was there at the library to take him to the airport right after the session.
We benefitted from his class learning different perspectives in life.
He was kind enough giving time meeting me personally at the library after the class couple of times answering patiently explaining the text clarifying any doubts.
He was calm, jovial, passionate with the subject and practicing/living unattached to material life.
Saw him last before he left for India and connected with email receiving texts and class schedule till recently.

With Sincere Prayers,

*Vijaya Shankar*
