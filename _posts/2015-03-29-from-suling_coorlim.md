Om Johari is such a powerful teacher who has lead by example in life as in death.

From Osho, *Philosophia Perennis*, Vol. 1, Talk #9:


>The man who has lived his life totally, intensely, passionately, without any fear – without any fear that has been created in you by the priests for centuries and centuries – if a person lives his life without any fear, authentically, spontaneously, death will not create any fear in him, not at all. In fact, death will come as a great rest. Death will come as the ultimate flowering of life. He will be able to enjoy death too; he will be able to celebrate death too.
 
>And remember, that is the criterion. If a person can enjoy and celebrate his death, that shows he has lived rightly; there is no other criterion. Your death will prove how you have lived.”


Thank you Dr. Om for sharing with me the beauty of both life and death.

*Om Shanti Shanti Shanti*
