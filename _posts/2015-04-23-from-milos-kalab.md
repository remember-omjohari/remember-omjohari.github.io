Dr. Om Johari will be remembered by food microscopists for having included them in 1979 in the international Scanning Electron Microscopy meetings which he used to organize. In 1982, he added the Food Microstructure journal to his publication program. It was later renamed Food Structure. - Om had a great understanding for microscopists from developing countries and he used to provide them with financial support to attend the meetings and to meet colleagues on a global scale, thus contributing to their scientific development and growth, if their manuscripts had been accepted for publication. It was very regrettable when, apparently for health reasons, he discontinued publishing the well-known journal at the end of 1993. By then, the seed of food microstructure studies had already been sown and they are flourishing nowadays again. Om will be remembered as one of their founders.
