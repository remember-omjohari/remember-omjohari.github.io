OM Uncle was always a big inspiration to all of us and will remain forever in our memory. He was very caring, sensitive, and helpful.  His attitude was of positive thinking, when something went wrong, he would say let us think on how to resolve, will find some solution and will comfort you with positive thoughts.

His advises on low cholesterol diet for Diabetics, use of Coconut Oil for mouth wash to keep teeth healthy and bad breadths out, are few of the good advises we can never forget.
May god rest his soul in peace and give strength to Anu Aunty, Mahesh, Ramesh and whole family strength to bear this great loss.
