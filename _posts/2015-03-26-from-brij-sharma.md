It was a shock, when I read the message about passing away of Mr. Om Johari about a week ago. I tried to forward that sad message to all members of seniors group as well as to the Hindu Satsang Group. Just four days (March 14th) before this sad news, we received a message "On Meditation" from him. He was so active in his life routines and in the community service, nobody in these groups believed that all of a sudden he was no longer with us. 

Mr. Om Johari was a spiritual leader and a social worker not only in the Indian community, but also in the American community at large. The Hindu Satsang Group and the Humanitarian Committee (Seniors Party) at the  Hindu Temple of Greater Chicago, invited him many times in their monthly meetings. His presentations on meditation and on other health related topics were very informative and educational. He was the one who started Naperville Laughing Group (NLG). Laughter Groups' meetings were usually held in peoples' homes and he would go to their meeting places and lead the group. His aspirations to teach the Safe Driver Courses to his friends were very well received. He used to email articles on OSHA techniques on spirituality and mediation almost everyday to his friends. He answered queries promptly on many topics to anybody who asked for very. 

Passing away of Mr. Om Johari at such an early age is a great loss to our community and he will be missed dearly. On behalf of Hindu Satsang Group as well as of Humanitarian Committee (Seniors Party) at the HTGC, I offer condolences to the Johari family. He will be in our prayers to the Almighty Lord for granting peace to his departed soul as well as for granting strength to all his loved ones to bear this loss.
Om Shanti! Shanti!! Shanti!!!
