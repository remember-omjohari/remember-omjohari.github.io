Kamlesh and I are extremely sorry to read your e-mail informing us about your father, Dr. Om Johari. Although I had only brief personal contact with him, I have known much about him from my elder brother. Indra Bhai Saheb always talked to me about Dr. Johri's conviction, and self-attestation, about well the low carbohydrate/high protein diet controlled Type II diabetes. He was an early believer in this concept, who now is proving to be right!!
Thanks for sharing his bio. We will remember his sharing his expertise and humor with us.
We wish his departed soul to rest in peace in Heaven.
