I was on the email list that was circulated notifying all about the passing of Dr. Johari on 18 March 2015.

Even though we had never met or exchanged pictures of each other, it never felt that we had never met personally. This was evidence of his ability to connect with folks all across the globe. About a year ago, I was introduced to him over email by two of his friends, Dr. Inder K. Somani (USA) and Prof. Dr. J. S. Rathore (India) and ever since that time, we exchanged one line messages intermittently when he would write in to check if I continued to receive his summary sheets on meditation. 

The Memorial website is an excellent idea and I would urge you to continue the circulation of his former programs - albeit at quarterly intervals as it was no easy task to reach out to a significant number of people even online. 

Prayers for the departed soul and strength to the Family. 

Regards,

*Uday Mathur, Mumbai*
