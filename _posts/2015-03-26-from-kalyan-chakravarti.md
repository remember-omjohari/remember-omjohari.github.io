Om was my class mate in IIT Kharagpur. He visited my house in Pune, where he had a friend, Dr Trivedi, who live close to me. He was a person of multiple talents. He excelled in his studies, and to the best of my knowledge, is to date, the only Metallurgical Engineer who won the president's gold medal of IIT Kharagpur.

Later in life, he turned his attention to spirituality, and the ancient alternative medical system of Ayurveda, widely practised in India. He did a lot of research on the beneficial effects of coconut in the prevention and arrest of Alzheimer's disease. He was passionate about community service and philanthropy. We, IIT Alumni grieve his loss, and pray for his Atma in a higher liberated form in his next life.
