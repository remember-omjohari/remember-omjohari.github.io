I wish I had the occasion to communicate with you under better circumstances. It is never easy to lose a loved one, no matter at what age. Words seem inadequate to express the sadness I feel about Dr. Johari.

I met him in the last couple of years.I had arranged two of his lectures at our community center "Islamic Society of Northwest Suburbs", in Rolling Meadows.  Despite few conversations, I always felt I knew him since a vey long time. I have vivid recollection of his down-to-earth personality. When I requested a paragraph for his introduction, for his first presentation, he said I do not have much to share, despite his great accomplishments, I read in your write-up.
