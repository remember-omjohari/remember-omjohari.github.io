I am really saddened to know that Dr. Johari has left us for heavenly abode to be among the Angels like himself. I met Dr. Johari about six years ago  when he came to share his wisdoms with our senior group at Share A Smile Chicago organization and he has left an indelible mark on my perspective of life. He taught me how to be a good human being and give selflessly. He will forever be missed. May his soul rest in peace.
