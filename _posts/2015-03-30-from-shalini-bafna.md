As I stepped on to Chicago for the first time as a newly wed, Johari Uncle came to the airport to pick us up.  He  was simply dressed in a white kurta pajama.  We went to their humble abode and instantly I realized that Uncle was a simple man inside and outside.  I have had the pleasure of his visits several time to our house.  I remember the many discussions that I have had with Uncle about religion, meditation, dance, dietary needs, raising children, etc... He never got upset when I disagreed with his views and always left you thinking about a different perspective.  I really respect Uncle as he lived and died the way he desired.  "Jo hora he hone do" was really his life motto.  If I learned anything from Uncle, it is that life will offer many negative situations but you can control your reaction to any situation.  Thank you Uncle for giving so much of your time in teaching us about life.  May your soul rest in peace.
