I attended many sessions of meditation with Om and must say that he was an amazing man.  I know that he would not say or even think that of himself, but he gave so much to so many for nothing in return.  Stubborn?  Oh yes he was, he would not even think of accepting a gift of appreciation for all that he did for us in his classes.  I learned a lot from him and will continue some of the meditation practices that I learned from him.
