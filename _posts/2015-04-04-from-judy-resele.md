First came disbelief, then grief, but after the Johari family shared their story of Om’s life, I moved to gratitude – a place I think Om would prefer me to be.  I am grateful he was able to live his life to its end on his terms.  I am grateful for the years of meditation instruction.  I am grateful for special phrases he used during his lessons that I took to heart, like “thy will be done” and “if inside is right outside does not matter”  and “what is is; what is not is not; so be it”.  Another of my favorites is not from Om, but I think he would approve: A life is only to be mourned if it has been wasted.  Om did not waste his life and to honor that I will remain in gratitude.  Thank you, Om, for caring and sharing your life with us.
