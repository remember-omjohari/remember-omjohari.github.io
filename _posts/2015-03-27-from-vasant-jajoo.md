It was shocking for us to receive this news on 19th March. We couldn’t believe it & hence had it confirmed from other common friends.
 
I used to visit Rolling Meadows, IL frequently during 2002-2006 & had the privilege to meet Om Masaji & Anu Masi. He was really a amazing person who had the ability to easily “connect” with a diverse set of people and with all age groups (I’m 30 yrs younger to him). I also had the privilege to take a “Om Johari tour of Chicago” along with him. During his India visits, he has also been with us at our home in Bangalore and had given some talks. We had several common interests viz. Health, Wellness, Food, Spirituality et.al. and of course that we are alumnus from IIT – Kharagpur.
 
I used to be always amazed at his zeal, enthusiasm & knowledge on diverse subjects and I would always draw out some enthusiasm from him into my life.
 
It was pleasure to hear that he was so “aware” during his last moments & is very fortunate to have such a peaceful departure.

Warmly,

*Vasant Jajoo, Yoga Therapist*
