Hi ,
I am really sad to know this.
I met him a couple of years back in OSHO  Ganga dham in Rishikesh and then in Delhi.
He was a remarkable person
He was one rare person who was able to grasp vision of OSHO and imbibe them in this life.

Let me mention that after going through osho revolution, people usually get more inclined to spiritual quest and lose control of other aspects of life.
He had all dimensions of life perfectly balanced.
Moreover his experience with diabetes care and ketonic diet was a encouraging testimony for us.

Wish all the best for his life after physical death.
