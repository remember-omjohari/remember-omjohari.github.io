1973 I met Om ji in his music gathering.  I was supposed to be one of singer. In few minutes Om told me you are next, In my humble way I said let others...

Om took my name off the list, during intermission misunderstanding cleared.  He said I asked him and he passed it.  So simple and straight forward Om was.  I became regular in these musical events which were treat for all music lovers.  It provided a platform for just one cause MUSIC so many new artists got introduced to Chicago Indian music group thru this.  And credit goes to Om ji.

I got reconnected to him thru his meditation classes and sharing OSHO teaching thru his regular emails. I attended Meditation workshop with him and Swamy Bagmar ji last summer. He brought so much awareness of life and life issues as well as death. He chose his life as well as death.

GOD BLESS HIM
