My sweetest memory of Om was many years ago when I worked for him and SEMI.  I would come from St. Louis and stay a weekend or several weeks.  Om and Anu shared their home with me each time.  Late one night, I was still on the computer and everyone else was in bed.  Om came down and told me to take a break.  Sitting at the kitchen table, he peeled and gave me my first pomegranate, telling me how his father would peel them for him in just the same way when he was a boy.  I was touched that he would share that story with me.
