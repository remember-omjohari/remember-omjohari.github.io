I heard a presentation at the Cook library in Libertyville this winter--
I so enjoyed his meditations--I knew right away that I was listening to a very special person.

I went to another meditation.

Since I travel a great deal--your Dad was kind enough to e mail me his meditations.

He shared his many gifts--without asking for anything in return--
I will always remember his kindness wisdom and generous spirit--very moving.

I am so sorry for your loss.
