My first memory of him was as instructor of the AARP Driver Safety class that I attended in 2012.  He was thorough and help me to adjust the side mirrors on my car.

Once again I saw him at the Arlington Heights Senior Center where he was having one of his meditations.  After that I started receiving them by email.

He will be missed.
