Thank you for contacting us about your father.
 I was shocked and greatly saddened by this news.
 My deepest condolences to you and your family.

My contact with your father was through the meditation classes that he taught in Elk Grove.
He was an extraordinary person and an excellent instructor.  He showed such
compassion, interest and generosity with all of his students.  I took two of his classes
and learned so much from him.  It was interesting that you mentioned his love of music
because he would always share his music with us during class.   Your father's explanation
of meditation was the simplest and yet most profound that I have ever heard or read: 
Meditation is bringing all of your attention to the present moment.

Your father never spoke of his other roles as a student, engineer, professor or father and grandfather---
so I am so pleased that you took the time to share that information with all of us.  Thank you.

What an amazing man; I am fortunate and grateful to have spent time with him and I will never forget him.
