I remember Om as a visitor to our home in San Francisco when I was a little girl. My father Joseph Kram's elder brother Michael was Om's friend at UC Berkeley.

Om taught us to make puris -- I was too young, but my elder brothers Kevin and Tony tried and could make the breads that would puff up so magically! To this day, puris are my favorite, and every time I have them there is a fond memory of Om.

I'm also delighted to hear of the path of laughter -- I will investigate!

Many blessings to you and yours,

*Yvonne Burgess (aka Scooter Kram), Berkeley CA*
