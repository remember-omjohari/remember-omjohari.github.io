I entered your father's meditation class in March, 2014 as a skeptic, just seeking an afternoon out of the house. I originally thought that the breathing et al was nonsense.  However, I returned the following week and just about every week for the past year. Om made a believer out of me, because he allowed the audience member to think about his message rather than "preaching." I came to respect him so much as a teacher.  How many people in our lives have had a transformational effect? In addition, I took his drivers' ed course and found it most practical: from meditation to driver ed...amazing!
 
I attended both the chapel service and the one at the Palatine Public Library, and the words were simply beautiful and inspiring. What a sui generis individual!
