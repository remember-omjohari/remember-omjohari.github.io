I am very sorry to hear about Om Johariâ€™s sudden demise. I never met him in person but I feeI I owe him much gratitude for guiding me towards a better health.  Kamala told me about how Om controlled his sugar thru diet and exercise. This prompted me to start a dialogue with him thru E-mail.  He told me about the diet he followed and about the benefits of coconut oil. I have been following his advice for the last 2 years and it has made a big difference in my life.

I will miss him as a mentor in my struggle with diabetes. May his soul rest in Peace.
