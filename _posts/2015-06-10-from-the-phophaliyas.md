First of all we submit our heartfelt condolences on the demise  of your father Shri Omji Johari on 18.03.2015. We pray to the Almighty for granting peace to the departed soul and give strength and courage to all the family members for this irreparable loss in this hour of bereavement.

We thank you for sharing Dr. Om Johari 1940-2015 and feel like sharing our remembrances also with your goodselves.

Our father Shri Laxmi Narayanji Phophaliya and your grandfather Shri Mohan Lal Ji Johari sahib were good friends.

Two years ago when Dr. Om visited Jodhpur we happened to meet him more than once. He addressed a large number of meetings including Shree Maheshwari Samaj Samiti, Western Region Jodhpur; Swami Vivekanand Students Welfare Charitable Trust, Manidweep, Jodhpur; Nature cure centre, Jodhpur and a couple of friends' residences etc. His deliberations were all based on personal researches made by him, lived and tried & trusted by him.

Subsequently we had telephonic and email contact with him regularly and he was kind enough to respond to our questions practically instantly, now he is physically not present but his dedication to the cause of humanity will be remembered for times immemorial.
