I met Dr OM JOHARI in Rishikesh in Osho Ganga Dham.  I was in a group and when we met. He discussed various health matters and specially the benefits of Coconut and its oil for the benefit of the body. He was very thorough in Osho Mediation and at my request started sending me his Views on Osho Meditation on regular basis. I carry his loving memories and Pray God to give him place in his feet.
