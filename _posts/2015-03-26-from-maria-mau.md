With deepest appreciation for sharing the life of Dr. Om Johari in the email I received today.  He touched me in a very positive way.  Although I could not attend as many of his sessions as I would have liked, he and his messages were special and thought provoking.  My ongoing struggles with cancer were helped by his insight about living.  My thoughts and prayers are with you all.

Sincerely, Maria Mau
