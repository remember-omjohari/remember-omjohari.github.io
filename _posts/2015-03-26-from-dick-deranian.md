I knew Dr. Johari only briefly as a candidate for the AARP Safe Driver Course.  While the time we spent together was brief he made an immediate awareness on me that here was a gentle, firm and intelligent person with a gift for life.  He will be missed by many of us.  God bless his life and memory.
