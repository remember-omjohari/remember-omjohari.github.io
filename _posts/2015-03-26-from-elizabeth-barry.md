Thanks you so much for taking the time to write everyone and for the details of Om's life and death.

I was so moved reading what you wrote us. He will be missed but I will remember him always. HE knows right now, that I play better Sudoku, drive more consciously, laugh more and sleep better because of him.  

But he taught me best of all, that all things are as they are supposed to be and to not stress.

Thanks again and I am so very sorry for your loss.
