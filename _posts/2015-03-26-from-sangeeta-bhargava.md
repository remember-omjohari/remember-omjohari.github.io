This world is full of humans, but very few know how to live like one...or perhaps some humans are simply much higher humans. Dr. Johari, a highly educated and intelligent man was so simple and humble, that just knowing him and his philosophy was a treat. My heart warms up when I think of him. I know I was very fortunate to have known him personally & listened to his talks. He had just one message for us: be grateful and be mindful. I hope I will have the power to remember this again and again. I know Dr. Johari would have said, "Don't worry if you forget, just come back when you remember and continue without analyzing it". God bless you Dr. Johari. You were such a special person. You showed many of us how to live our lives.

Respectfully remembering Dr. Johari.
