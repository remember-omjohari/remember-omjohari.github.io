Dear Om,

You often stated that "we are never born and we never die", so, I know that you have only changed form and are still with us, but I do miss you. Especially, your daily/weekly emails. I used to look forward to your emails and they reminded me of who we are and what our essence is, and how to live our lives from that perspective. Your emails helped me become a better person.

I am grateful for having known you and for all the blessings that you brought. You were a manifestation of the divine in human form.

Namaste, OM !!

With gratitude,

*Sunil*
