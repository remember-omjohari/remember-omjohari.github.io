Om -- My Thank You for accepting me as a AARP instructor in 2011.
 
I feel your encouragement and mentoring over the years with AARP  gave me the confidence to be a AARP instructor.
  
You had always an open view about my ideas and it was a pleasure to work for you.
 
You were a kind man and seeing the accomplishments you achieve over  your lifetime, you can add great job for your community service with AARP.
 
 
Lastly, your son wrote a great tribute to you and  should be very proud of what he wrote.
 
You will be missed.
 
*Michael Tracy*
