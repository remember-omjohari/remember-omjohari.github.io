I had just retired from 32 years of teaching last June. I decided I was going to focus on enriching my mind, body, and spirit. I saw that the Palatine library had a meditation program each week. That sounded perfect.  I signed up and attended my first program in June.

From the moment Dr. Johari began the program, I knew it was going to be different from anything I had experienced before. Meditation was part of my yoga practice and I had completed quite a few Deepak Chopra series, but this was different. Dr. Johari focused on a different theme each week, exposing me to many scholars and references for me to further my study.  He had us read from a script that he had composed and it was a great way to not only prompt discussion, but to connect with the others attending.  Then we would meditate in a variety of ways.

Dr. Johari brought great meaning to my life. I began applying his basic principles daily. Things like "live in the present", "mindful eating", "What is, is, what isn't, isn't, so be it", "learn to listen mindfully and not judge", "if you feel hurt by someone, it's because that is how YOU react to others behavior, it's your choice", and so on. I hear his voice so many times and it brings me to awareness.


I had just recently gotten on his email list. He asked me to introduce myself to him at the next program. I am so happy now that he knew who I was. There are no mistakes. He meant so much to me.

The last few weeks, he seemed a little slower and more fragile physically, but his spirit and teaching never wavered. I was devastated to learn of his passing. It will be a big hole to fill. I know that he would not want me to grieve, but to live his teachings fully. That is how I will honor him.

The day he passed, I went to a bookstore and bought a book by OSHO. It will forever remind me of the man I feel so blessed to have known.
