I met Om when I coordinated with him to give his Laughter Yoga talk at the River Forest Public Library.  This was several years ago and people still remember the talk.  Om is not a person easily forgotten and I'm so sorry to learn of his passing.  What a truly amazing person Om was!  I hope you and your family are comforted by all of the fond words regarding Om.

With warm regards,

Blaise
