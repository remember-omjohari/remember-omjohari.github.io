Itâ€™s really very sad that ours Bhai Sahib Dr. Om Johri is now not with us. I pray God to help you and your family to bear this irreparable loss. I got in touch with Bhai Sahib in 1967 and till last I was associated with him. The eulogy attached by you is truly terrific and I was not fully aware earlier. Such type of literacy and simplicity is seen very seldom. Om Bhai Sahib was very neat and constantly taught us new things every time. Last visit In India he spent lots of time with our family. The hours we sat with him enjoyed so many matters. That time we never though that this will be the last sitting with him.
 
He was very great and taught us how we can enjoy our lifetime with outstanding ease. We never forget Bhai Sahib. He will forever be with us in our recollection.

Please convey my regards to your mother and love to all.
   
With Love,
