Dr. Om so often quoted Osho who had this to say about death:

“Everything returns to its original source, has to return to its original source. If you understand life then you understand death also. Life is a forgetfulness of the original source, and death is again a remembrance. Life is going away from the original source, death is coming back home. Death is not ugly, death is beautiful. But death is beautiful only for those who have lived their life unhindered, uninhibited, unsuppressed. Death is beautiful only for those who have lived their life beautifully, who have not been afraid to live, who have been courageous to live – who loved, who danced, who celebrated."  (Osho, The Art of Dying, Talk #1.)

Dr. Om loved, laughed, danced, and celebrated life to the fullest.  He also generously shared his wisdom with all of us.  Each week I would go home from his classes with interest piqued to study new authors and ideas - eager to try the many and varied meditation techniques he taught us.  He impacted my life in so many beautiful ways.
In a class some time back he mentioned  a list of quotes by Anthony de Mello (ONE MINUTE WISDOM) and I asked if he'd send me a copy.   I only read the email after his death and was struck by relevance of this quote:

"As the Master grew old and infirm, the disciples begged him not to die.  Said the Master, " If I did not go, how would you ever see?"  
"What is it we fail to see when you are with us?" they asked.
But the Master would not say.
When the moment of his death was near, they said, "What is it we will see when you are gone?"
With a twinkle in his eye, the Master said, " All I did was sit on the riverbank handing out river water.
After I'm gone, I trust you will notice the river"

Farewell, Om, and thank you for so generously handing out the river water.

In Gratitude,
Trish
