This is my feeble, though sincere, attempt to touch everybody who had been ' Touched' by Respected Dr. Johari Saheb during his sojourn in this world. The journey, like a river,ran its course and finally merged and became one with its destination. Om.....mmmmm.....
 
One can only attempt, but can never fully justify the process of creating a word-picture of this multi-faceted gem of an individual. Family members,relatives,friends, business associates and many many more individuals came to know him based upon their own perspective and need, and he did his BIT so efficiently and seemingly effortlessly! I have witnessed him in action with awe and admiration. Wow, such a clarity, such an empathy, such an indomitable energy, combined with pure humility, and yes, force. His direct and courageous way of dealing with life and people made him stand apart.
 
I came to know him because of quarterly music get-togethers that he arranged in his home for many many years. Slowly, I got introduced to spiritual aspect, reading through and practicing Osho's books and meditation avenues.Once again, words of thankfulness and gratitude are not going to suffice to justify the depth of emotions, so I 'LET IT BE'.
 
His vision of life has become purified, transperant and very clear to him over the period of time and he persued it unflinchingly. To us, it seemed so effortless, so simple, yet so huge!!
 
Let me just say this-- In the deep cave of my heart, there is a flowing stream where I would just sit by and watch small pearls of his memory float by.....
 
*Gate...Gate.....*

	Gone....Gone...

*Paragate....*

	Gone beyond

*Parasaamgate........*

	Gone further than beyond

*Bodhiswaahaa........*

	Surrender to Buddha, The Enlighened.


Sincerely,

*Renu...Suresh...Gami*
