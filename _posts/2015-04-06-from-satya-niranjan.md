Thank you very much for sending the eulogy of Beloved Om Bhai Saab.  Though I enjoyed intimate friendship with him I did not know so many glorious achievements of his career. That was his great quality not to mention his successes. In my 10 years of intimacy with him I got to learn so many good things from him. I would mention a few of them which brought qualitative change in my life.

1. From him I learnt the art of listening to others. He says  whenever you have some conversation with somebody, always be patient and attentive to listen that other person,if though you feel that you already know what he is going to say. May be he has some important point to make at the end. Moreover by listening to him fully, you show your respect for him. That way we can avoid unnecessary controversies. I found it very profound advice in my life.

2. I learnt the art of eating from him. He told not to touch the spoon or to take next bite unless you have completely swallowed the first one while eating. Normally we tend to forget such practical advices. But his compassion was such that once when my wife and myself were travelling with him to reach the next venue of our programme, we were required to take our lunch in the car. My wife was sitting on the rear seat, Om ji was driving and  I was besides him. My wife prepared the dish for me from the tiffin which Anu ji had kindly given us while starting from the home. When I put the first bite in my mouth and took the second one towards the mouth, he firmly held my hand and said,"Bhai Saab,first eat the first bite fully and then touch the next one" this went so deep in me that since then rarely I might have forgotten it.By the way these days while taking my food I invariably gratefully remember Om ji and his compassion.

3. There are many other things that I learnt from him and try to follow in my life.His way of organising the programmes so perfectly well that I could attend dozens of meditation programmes without any change or difficulty, when I visited him three time for 2 weeks each time during last 3 years. From my heart I salute him for this. His eagerness to help others without any personal motive was beyond words. Rarely one finds such personality which is not concerned with any appreciation or criticism.

4. Lastly I would like to mention one important aspect of his life which is strangely absent from the eulogy you sent. That is his devotion for Osho's teaching. I personally know how sincere he was to learn Osho's meditation technics. 3 years before when he had come to Pune, he visited Osho Meditation Resort and participated in 10 days programme to learn how to lead the Osho meditations anywhere in the world. Not only this, but he attended each Osho meditation camp that I was conducting while he was in India. He must have attended at least 10 such camps. He also stayed in so many Osho Meditation Centres in India during his stay here. Moreover in his efforts to teach meditation to people through his regular sessions at various places in USA and through his extensive e-mail correspondence, he invariably used Osho's quotes and based on that prepared meditation technics for his presentations.  I have myself experienced it. I have seen about 100 Osho books in his personal library.

Apart from Osho, I have rarely come across such multi-dimensional personality in my life. His impact on my life is so deep that though he is not in his physical body his being will continue guiding me. The way he departed from his body, it seems he   was fully conscious. Only his body has died but his being will continue inspiring us. I bow down to that Devine energy. Love!
