I had the privilege of knowing Dr. Om for only a very brief time.  I attended his weekly meditation classes at Palatine Public Library. From the very first week, I knew my good fortune to encounter such a person.  He was generous with his time, knowledge and materials and he very positively impacted my life at a time of great personal transition.  I think of him daily and will remember him as I continue to be his student.
