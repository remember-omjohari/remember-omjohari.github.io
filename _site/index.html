He frequently taught both meditation and AARP Driver Safety classes here. He was always an upbeat and kind person that everyone wanted to be around and I personally really enjoyed the opportunity to work with him and to get to know him.</p>

	  <span class="post-content"><p>I attended the visitation and service for Om yesterday. It was beautiful. For those who don’t know, he died from a cancer that they found out about last November or so. He didn’t want chemo treatments and then several days ago had surgery, went home and had a heart attack. Of course he was not afraid of dying and he told his son to go to sleep while he was dying. Doesn’t that sound just like him? The last thing he said to us at last week’s class was to look at your loved ones with deep gratitude that they are in your life. There are few people that have had such a deep effect as he did. He taught us how to destress ourselves. What a gift.</p>

	  <span class="post-content"><p>Kamlesh and I are extremely sorry to read your e-mail informing us about your father, Dr. Om Johari. Although I had only brief personal contact with him, I have known much about him from my elder brother. Indra Bhai Saheb always talked to me about Dr. Johri’s conviction, and self-attestation, about well the low carbohydrate/high protein diet controlled Type II diabetes. He was an early believer in this concept, who now is proving to be right!!
Thanks for sharing his bio. We will remember his sharing his expertise and humor with us.
We wish his departed soul to rest in peace in Heaven.</p>

Every time if someone asked me a spiritual question, or I had a question; all I had to do was think and next day his email contained the answer.
I never had to ask him the question, somehow through divine intervention I always got the answer from him.
Attached is a copy of the blog I wrote the day he passed away.</p>

	  <span class="post-content"><p>It was a shock, when I read the message about passing away of Mr. Om Johari about a week ago. I tried to forward that sad message to all members of seniors group as well as to the Hindu Satsang Group. Just four days (March 14th) before this sad news, we received a message “On Meditation” from him. He was so active in his life routines and in the community service, nobody in these groups believed that all of a sudden he was no longer with us. </p>
